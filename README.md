Portfolio Project for SNHU CS300 Data Structures and Algorithms

### What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

The problem we were solving in this course was for a college course catalog program that would need to parse a file with information on many courses, store it in a data structure, and perform operations on that data using searching, sorting, insertion, and removal algorithms. Some of these functions were simply to display the information to the screen, but the goal was to find the most efficient and effective data structure to implement for the required use cases, based on various factors.

### How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.



### How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?



### How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?



### How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
