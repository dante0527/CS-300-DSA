Portfolio Project for SNHU CS300 Data Structures and Algorithms

### What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

The problem we were solving in this course was for a college course catalog program that would need to parse a file with information on many courses, store it in a data structure, and perform operations on that data using searching, sorting, insertion, and removal algorithms. Some of these functions were simply to display the information to the screen, but the goal was to find the most efficient and effective data structure to implement for the required use cases, based on various factors.

### How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

I approached this problem by first getting experience with each different data structure, understanding how it performs different operations, and what time complexities were occurrent with each function. Based on the size of the input and the nature of the data, I ended up recommending a hash table for the course catalog program, after confirming its efficiency and effectiveness with runtime analysis. Understanding the underlying data structures that you use is of great importance when choosing which one to implement a program, because each one might do the same thing in a very different way, so it really depends on your input which one would be the best to go with.

### How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

Most of the roadblocks I encountered while going through the steps of this project had to do with my IDE, Visual Studio. Getting to know how files communicate with each other in different languages and environments is something that will take time and experience, but I am glad to have learned a lot from working through each challenge. I now feel much more comfortable with a full fledged IDE like Visual Studio, as opposed to a much simpler editor like VS Code. Any difficulties that I had understanding data structures or algorithms just required a little extra time thinking about them to fully understand.

### How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

This project and this course as a whole have opened my mind to abstract data types and customizing a data structure to behave in any way you need it to. Previously, I had been using a lot of built in data types or combinations of them to create my own structure to solve a specific problem, and coming up with my own algorithms for them, but this made my code very specific to that single application, so I never got to recognize an established structure. Now I've had experience with many different things like all of the different kinds of lists, trees, and hash tables that I will continue using going forwards.

### How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

Along with having more and better choices for data structures that I can use for more than one application, I have gotten experience with in-code documentation, and using C++ to express my code in a more visually appealing way. Without using excessive commenting, I found more ways to space out and divide code into parts, nest certain functions in better places, and choose simpler solutions to things I often encounter.
